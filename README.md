# Skilistas

Sites like Airtasker or gumtree offer services for hire, however the services are for all Australia. The goal of Skilistas is to bring the Tasmanian community close and let the neigbours know any professional that might be living by. Usually when we need services like a mechanic to fix our car, we ask our freinds if they have any recommendation, and the goal of this project is that friends can recommend someone as well through the web site.

## What is Skilistas?

 Services for hire.

Skilistas is a platform that connect skilled professionals to clients in Tasmania.

## How does it work?

Skiled people such as pumblers, electricians, developers, engineers, drivers, cleanners and more, can registry on Skislistas and create a profile, their profile will contains contact details about the professional, images, and descriptions, also ratings and recomendations from clients.
The contact details will be available only for users that sign up at the website. Propessionals will be able to rate their clients and make recomendations too.

## Payment - not added

At this moment no payment method, but the idea is to create a mobile app and after the job is done, the professional can go to the app and generate a payment, the client then scan the code with their mobile and the payment is succeded.
